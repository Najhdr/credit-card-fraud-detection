# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning to the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## What’s inside
- **eda.py** → data exploration and visualizations  
- **train.py** → preprocessing and training setup  
- **models.py** → Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models  

## Goal
Detect fraudulent transactions in highly imbalanced data.  
Evaluation is done with confusion matrices, precision/recall, and ROC-AUC.  

## Tools
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
